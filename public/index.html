<!-- 2.>>> (you find 1.>>> in index.js) This folder is a folder in which we will rarely work but it holds one
important file.This index.html file.This is the single HTML file,which is in the
end loaded by the browser here.This is basically the only HTML file that is
being used by this overall React application because it's a so-called single
page application.It has a single HTML file -->
<!-- The div with the id root in this case.That's a regular div,which actually
doesn't hold any content,but that's the div where we want to attach or inject
our React-driven user interface. -->
<!-- So it's this div where the React-based user interface should be rendered into
and therefore, in index.js,it's this div with the id root (=> in index.js: const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render() )-->
<!-- so what's inside of this div (root)should be replaced in index.js with that:(<App/>) -->
<!-- => go to app.js for more info -->
